# RUN TESTS from interface

If you are using VSCode, running tests and running specific tests can be done from the interface.

1. Click on the **Test Explorer** (beaker)
2. open the **e2e** ==> view of all the tests show
3. Hover over the test ==> buttons for running, debugging display
4. click on the button and run the specific test as you build them.

**NOTE: the "problem user" test fails, because I purposefully coded it to fail (it is looking for an error message, which never shows up)**

# Page Object Naming - 

GIVEN I name the page elements based on their type initially
WHEN I type the first initial
THEN All matching elements will populate, making it easy for anyone on the team to choose an element 
AND if no results appear, the member will know to add them.
WHEN I add every page and helper to allPages.ts
THEN I can reduce the number of lines to call the pages and helpers.

Button - btnName

Caption - capName

Checkbox - cbName

Drop Down List - ddlName

Error - errName

Field - fName

Heading - hName

Image - ImgName

Logo - logoName

Menu - mName

Navigation Bar - nbName

Page - pName

Radio Button - rbName

Section - secName

Tab - tabName

Text - txtName

**p.Login.fUserName** is easy to understand
