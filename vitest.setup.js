// vitest.setup.js

// This file is often used to extend matchers or set up a test environment.

// Example: If you wanted to use advanced Jest matchers (requires 'jest-extended' package)
// import { expect } from 'vitest';
// import * as matchers from 'jest-extended';
// expect.extend(matchers);

// Since we are only using Node.js modules for file system checks, 
// this file can be empty (or deleted) unless you have another specific global setup need.
